The system comprises several distinct pages catering to different functionalities. First is the login page, serving as the entry point for authorized users. Upon successful authentication, users are directed to a dashboard page presenting comprehensive statistics relevant to their role or activity within the system.

Another key feature is the document management aspect, facilitated through multiple pages. Users can send documents to fellow employees via a dedicated page, and track their own sent documents through a personal documents page. Here, users have the capability to delete documents or archive them for future reference.

A robust search functionality allows users to query and download documents from a centralized repository. Additionally, unprocessed documents sent by other employees are collected on a separate page. These documents default to a "pending" status and can be processed, marked as "processing", "completed", or "refused" via an edit function. Only documents with a status of "completed" or "refused" are considered processed.

Processed documents are segregated onto their own page for easy reference, while archived documents reside on a dedicated page. Here, users can download, delete, or restore documents as needed.

Furthermore, a contact page facilitates communication between employees, offering a search feature to locate specific individuals. Each employee is represented by a card displaying pertinent information such as name, department, email address, and telephone number.

Lastly, users have access to a profile modification page enabling them to update personal details including full name, email, telephone number, department, and password. This comprehensive suite of features ensures efficient document management and seamless employee collaboration within the system.
